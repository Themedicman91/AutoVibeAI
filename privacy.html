  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>AutoVibeAI is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data while automating TikTok video posting.</p>
  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We collect minimal data required to operate AutoVibeAI, including TikTok API access tokens and user authentication data. No personal user data (e.g., email, name) is stored.</p>
  <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>Data accessed via TikTok API (e.g., trends, video metadata) is used solely for AI analysis and video generation. We use third-party services like OpenAI and Pika.art, which may process this data per their policies.</p>
  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share your data with third parties except as required to operate the service (e.g., TikTok API, OpenAI, Pika.art). We comply with TikTok's API guidelines.</p>
  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to secure your data, but no system is 100% secure. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your TikTok account.</p>
  <h2>5. Changes to Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be posted on this page, and your continued use constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions about this Privacy Policy, contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@autovibeai.com">support@autovibeai.com</a>.</p>
